4.Analysis:
(a) Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.

-Linear Search:
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
  - It checks each element one by one, so the time taken grows linearly with the number of elements.

-Binary Search:
  - Time Complexity: O(log n)
  - It divides the list in half each time, drastically reducing the number of steps needed â€” but it only works if the data is sorted.

(b) Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

For an e-commerce platform handling large datasets of products,binary search is more suitable due to its faster search performance (O(log n)).
However,it requires the product list to be sorted. If the dataset is small or constantly changing,linear search may still be appropriate in those limited cases.

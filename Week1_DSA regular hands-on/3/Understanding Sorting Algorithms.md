1)Explain different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).

-Bubble Sort:
This is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they’re in the wrong order.
It is easy to implement but inefficient for large datasets.

-Insertion Sort:
It builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position.
It is efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets.

-Quick Sort:
A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot', partitions the array, and recursively sorts the partitions.
It’s very efficient for large datasets.

-Merge Sort:
Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the results.
It’s stable and predictable but uses more space.
